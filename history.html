		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<p>Records show that falcons (raptors) have been used by humans in China to hunt as far back as 2205 BC. The falcons back then were referred to as "royal gifts" and the art of falconry was reserved for the wealthy and royalty.</p>
		
		<p>Pictures in Persia and Arabia depict falconers with birds on their wrists in 1700 BC. In 1600 falconry reached its peak in England and is governed by strict rules as to what type of flacon could be flown by the members of the royal family. There was a hierarchy in the choice of birds from the king down to the priests.</p>
		
		<p>In 1970 peregrine falcons were placed on the endangered species list with only 39 known breading pairs in the Western U.S. The peregrines would remain on the endangered species list until August 20, 1999 when they were removed from the list. The recovery of the peregrine falcon was due in large part to captive breading programs and the sport of falconry.</p>
