			<h2>Peregrines</h2>
			<h3>North American Subspecies:</h3>
			
				<ol>
					<li><em>Falco peregrinus anatum</em> is the most common peregrine in the contiguous United States and southern Canada and is also called the American peregrine. The Latin word "anatum" means eater of ducks. This is the group that came close to extinction in the latter part of the 20th century.</li>

					<li><em>Falco peregrinus pealei</em>, or Peale's peregrine, named for Titian R. Peale, an early 19th century Philadelphia artist, is found mostly along the Northwest coast of the United States, the western coast of Canada, the Aleutians and the Bearing Sea. This maritime species does not migrate and was not as severely affected by man-made chemicals.</li>

					<li><em>Falco peregrinus tundrius</em>is also known as the Arctic Peregrine and the "tundrius" refers to the terrain of the far north-the tundra. Scientists believe that these birds were reduced by about 50 percent during the 1960's and 70's. They were removed from the "threatened" list in 1994.</li>
