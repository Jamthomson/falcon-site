		<p>Falconry is an art that requires long hours, constant training, skill, finesse and subtlety. Think about it, you are taking a wild bird, letting it go hunt and then expecting that same bird to come back to captivity, willingly.</p> 
		<p>Ted Benzon, administrator for South Dakota's Game, Fish and Parks puts it like this:</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>"Falconry is not a hobby; it is a lifestyle. Falconers must devote time to their birds each and every day, <strong>365</strong> days a year."</p>
